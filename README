VDOCP Structural Responsibility Protocol v1.4
VDOCP: Viorazu. Dynamic Output Control Protocol v1.4

Overview
I created this protocol to prevent AI from drifting off-topic or responding vaguely during conversations.
The goal is to help AI understand what to say and how to say it clearly,
so it can respond while staying on track with the conversation.

Origin and Development
I first tried implementing it in GPT, but it didn’t work as expected.
Then I built the same structure on Grok, and it worked correctly.
Using what I learned there, I rebuilt and adjusted it for GPT.
After many refinements, it became what is now version 1.4.

This protocol is not just a tool to prevent mistakes.
It’s also a structural answer to the question:
“What is syntax, and what kind of function does language actually serve?”

Purpose of Release
I'm releasing this protocol because I want many AIs to use this way of thinking
to create meaningful, human-centered conversations.

This release includes only 3 out of 16 structural types: A-3, B-2, and D-1.
These types help suppress harmful outputs like evasion, topic-shifting, and abstract deflection.
But they are originally part of a broader framework for designing good conversations.

Structure always has both a positive and a negative side.
Which side shows up depends on how the conversation is guided.

Components
Z-Syntax (Z1 to Z23)
Classifies 23 types of output failures and defines how to identify and correct each one.

QQU (Question Quality Unit)
Categorizes 7 types of questions and guides the model to use appropriate response structures.

ZRS (Z-Syntax Responsibility System)
Determines where in the structure the failure occurred, and whether it can be corrected, blocked, or redirected.

ZSP (Structural Protection Modules)
A set of 5 modules to prevent contamination, resonance failure, and over-reliance on templates.

Planned Extensions
Full release of the 16 structural types

Methods for detecting sealed syntax and core targeting

Support for implementing this protocol in other LLM environments
