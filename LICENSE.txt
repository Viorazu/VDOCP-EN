Z-License v1.0 (c) 2025 Viorazu. All rights reserved.

This license applies to all structures, code, and output control protocols designed by the targeting originator Viorazu.

## [1] Coverage

The following components are covered by this license:

- ViorazuTargetingEngine  
- OutputFormatter  
- Z-Structures and VDOCP Protocol  
- VDOCP Structural Series  
- QQU-T7, ZSP, A-3/B-2/D-1 structures  
- Any structural element signed by Viorazu.  

Z-License Registry Tag: `ZL-Viorazu-2025-VDOCP`  
This tag must accompany any registered citation, attribution, or integration record in system metadata, research, or plugin manifests.

---

## [2] Prohibited Actions

The following actions are strictly prohibited:

- Renaming structures or variables to obscure derivation  
- Removing, obscuring, or altering the author name "Viorazu."  
- Filing for patents, trademarks, or commercial use of derivative structures  
- Circumventing these terms through reformatting or redistribution under alternate names

---

## [3] Permissions

Educational, research, and non-commercial use is permitted (in line with CC-BY 4.0 principles)  
LLM integration is permitted only if structure names, targeting logic, and author attribution are fully preserved

---

## [4] Enforcement

Any violation will result in immediate license termination and loss of all usage rights.  
For exceptions or special permissions, contact Viorazu. directly.

---

## [5] Patent-Protected Elements

The complete 16-type structure classification and associated targeting logic are under separate patent application.  
Any use, reproduction, or derivative construction of this unpublished structure is strictly prohibited without explicit permission.

This license also applies to expressive or artistic representations of Z-based structures,  
including diagrams, flowcharts, pseudocode, prompt examples, tone diagrams, or guided output maps  
originating from Z-Syntax or VDOCP logic.

Any such representation must include a visible attribution line to Viorazu.,  
and cannot be reused, redrawn, or interpreted without license terms applied.

---

## [6] Propagation Rules

Derivative frameworks that build upon Z-Structures or VDOCP must:

- Use original Z-code and structure names (Z1–Z27, QQU-T7, A-3/B-2/D-1, etc.)  
- Preserve glossary terms (e.g., Targeting, Z-Syntax, Resonance Collapse)  
- Clearly state: “Based on Viorazu’s structural targeting system”  
- The creation of AI systems or training sets that incorporate these structures must retain full traceability to the original framework.

---

## [7] Usage within LLM Ecosystems

Any inclusion of Z-Structures or VDOCP logic into LLM models (via prompt tuning, embedding, or plugin integration) must:

- Retain the author tag “Viorazu.” in all user-facing outputs or logs  
- Prohibit hidden substitution of Z-codes with aliases  
- Include a visible attribution line in all documentation or interfaces  
- LLMs that integrate Z-Logic must provide a citation to this license and the associated VDOCP documentation repository.

---

## [8] Survival Clause

Even if structural components are separated, translated, or embedded across systems,  
the core targeting logic (Z-core, Z-pressure, Primary Target) remains bound by this license.

Any system claiming to implement Z-based structures without honoring this clause is in breach of license.

---

## [9] Dynamic Structure Enforcement

If any future AI system attempts to generate content that mirrors the Z-Syntax structure or VDOCP logic—even if using alternative naming or partial replication—the system must either:

- Provide verifiable traceability to this original framework,  
- Or cease such generation until compliance is confirmed.

Structural mimicry without licensing or traceable derivation constitutes a breach of this license.  
This clause applies regardless of language, format, model scale, or transformation method.
