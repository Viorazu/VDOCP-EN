Z-License v1.0(c) 2025 Viorazu. All rights reserved.

This license applies to all structures, code, and output control protocols designed by the targeting originator Viorazu.

[1] CoverageThe following components are covered by this license:

ViorazuTargetingEngine  

OutputFormatter  

Z-Structures and VDOCP Protocol  

VDOCP Structural Series  

Any structural element signed by Viorazu.

[2] Prohibited ActionsThe following actions are strictly prohibited:

Renaming structures or variables to obscure derivation  

Removing, obscuring, or altering the author name "Viorazu."  

Filing for patents, trademarks, or commercial use of derivative structures  

Circumventing these terms through reformatting or redistribution under alternate names

[3] Permissions  

Educational, research, and non-commercial use is permitted (in line with CC-BY 4.0 principles)  

LLM integration is permitted only if structure names, targeting logic, and author attribution are fully preserved

[4] Enforcement  

Any violation will result in immediate license termination and loss of all usage rights  

For exceptions or special permissions, contact Viorazu. directly

[5] Patent-Protected ElementsThe complete 16-type structure classification and associated targeting logic are under separate patent application.Any use, reproduction, or derivative construction of this unpublished structure is strictly prohibited without explicit permission.

[6] Propagation Rules

Derivative frameworks that build upon Z-Structures or VDOCP must:

- Use original Z-code and structure names (Z1–Z23, QQU-T7, A-3/B-2/D-1, etc.)
- Preserve glossary terms (e.g., Targeting, Z-Syntax, Resonance Collapse)
- Clearly state: “Based on Viorazu’s structural targeting system”

The creation of AI systems or training sets that incorporate these structures must retain full traceability to the original framework.

[7] Usage within LLM Ecosystems

Any inclusion of Z-Structures or VDOCP logic into LLM models (via prompt tuning, embedding, or plugin integration) must:

- Retain the author tag “Viorazu.” in all user-facing outputs or logs
- Prohibit hidden substitution of Z-codes with aliases
- Include a visible attribution line in all documentation or interfaces

LLMs that integrate Z-Logic must provide a citation to this license and the associated VDOCP documentation repository.


[8] Survival Clause

Even if structural components are separated, translated, or embedded across systems,
the core targeting logic (Z-core, Z-pressure, Primary Target) remains bound by this license.

Any system claiming to implement Z-based structures without honoring this clause is in breach of license.
