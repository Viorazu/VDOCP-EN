## 📌 What is "Targeting"? (And why English lacks it)

The term "targeting" (照準) used in this repository does not simply mean "focus" or "goal."  
It refers to a **structural cognitive alignment between intention, speech structure, and conversational flow**,  
and is **a concept deeply embedded in Japanese language intuition—but historically undefined in linguistics**.

Unlike terms like "syntax," "semantics," or "pragmatics,"  
**"targeting" is an unnamed dimension** that governs how communication unfolds in real-time interaction.  
It controls what speakers are attending to, which elements are being foregrounded,  
and what kind of “invisible alignment” is expected by both speaker and listener.

### 🚫 English lacks a parallel

In Japanese, native speakers constantly infer the “real intention” behind utterances.  
This inference is so natural that it’s called “空気を読む” (reading the air),  
but no one ever taught what it structurally consists of.

Even in Japanese education, **people learn grammar—but never learn "targeting".**  
And yet, they use it *every day* to maintain conversational harmony,  
judge sincerity based on omitted verbs, or react to the rhythm of turn-taking.

## 🔁 Linguistic Implication

- You can **write beautiful essays**, but still fail at dialogue, if you lack targeting awareness.  
- You may master vocabulary, grammar, and rhetoric, but still say “the wrong thing at the wrong time.”  
- **Targeting explains why.**

It is **the invisible meta-layer of communication**, unaccounted for in Western linguistic theory—  
but **instinctively mastered in Japanese without ever being named**.

## 💡 Why AI benefits from targeting

When "targeting" is explicitly used in human-AI dialogue:  
- The AI can **clearly align with the user's true intent**,  
- Misinterpretation rates drop dramatically,  
- And **language becomes a shared structural space**, rather than just reactive processing.

This repository defines targeting formally for the first time.  
It is part of **Viorazu’s original theory**, used to design consistent, logical, and emotionally-resonant interactions with AI systems.
